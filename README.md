# Beckmann-distribution

This code collection reproduces some of the images from both papers. For detailed information about the paper, please see "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7876099" and"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8239659". 

The figure 7 shown in the first paper can not be completely reproduced because the author did not give all the parameters, and figure 8 and figure 9 in the second paper are mostly reproduced. 

In addition, a new series of lower bound derivations for Beckmann distribution were carried out using different methods, and the results are presented in a PDF file called "New_Bounds_concerning_Bekmann". Since this part of the work results has not been published, only some of the existing results are presented. If you are interested in this project and the existing results, please do not embezzle, contact me in time.



Those codes were completed between August and October 2022 by Maximal-K.
